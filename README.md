Student Performance Data Analysis involves evaluating academic records to identify trends, strengths, and areas for improvement among students. By analyzing metrics such as grades, attendance, and study hours, educators can determine factors influencing performance. This process often includes grouping data by categories like GPA, study hours, or assessment types, and using tools like Excel for pivot tables and charts. The insights gained from this analysis help in making data-driven decisions to enhance teaching strategies and improve overall student outcomes.
